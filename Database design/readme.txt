2. will display table ,or will not display anything if we are either inserting or updating or if we are executing a syntactically wrong query(ie no error messgaes as everything is suppressed!!)

what is yet to be done+what I want you guys to do:-

Firstly, to test this install xampp , and then go to the localhost/phpmyadmin and create a database called "ipl league" and insert the sql given in the "FINAL IPL.sql" file to the sql in your newly created database.
secondly,just put this entire folder in the htdocs folder and then try opening the index page of the querysearch(That is where all the magic happens!!). 
Then....do this shit.
1.add a few more insertions to the fixtures table
2.remove the extra bad values i added in umpire table(it will be obvious) during testing
3.improve css of the page by making the 3 buttons below the text box align horizontally.
4.if you want to make the background picture make it  something cricket-themed.
5.if you want to try to make the table which appears better looking try doing it else leave it!


If this is done WE ARE DONE WITH THIS FUCKING PROJECT!
