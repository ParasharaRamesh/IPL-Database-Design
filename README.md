# IPL-Database-Design
-The folder Database Design includes a sql file for "phpmyadmin apache server" where we have designed a database for multiple IPL seasons.This was done as a part of our Database Management Course to show the design of multiple tables using various entity-relationship diagrams.



-the folder query-search contains a simple web UI to run queries on the database we created and get results of matching rows.The file "IPL DB queries example.sql" contiains various examples of queries ranging from simple to complex nested queries which can be tested on our database.
